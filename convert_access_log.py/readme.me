The convert_access_log.py file is focused on converting the log generated by the Apache application with the file name access.log to a file that is easy to read by other forensic tools.

The conversion performed will be from a ".log" to ".csv" file.

After the conversion, tools can be used to open the csv file, such as Timeline Explorer.

It is necessary to change in the script the path to the file to be converted and the path to the final dump.
